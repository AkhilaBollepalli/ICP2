Problem 1: To take two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to the fullname function that should return the (full name).
Input: 2 Strings
Output: String
Solution:
1. The user strings are taken, stored in the "first_name" and "last_name" variables, then sent to the "full_name" function, which concatenates them into a single string using the '+' operator.
2. The user string is extracted, stored in the "original_string" variable, and passed to the function "string_alternative".
3. The function returns alternate characters using the slicing operator with a step of 2.
Problem 2: To find the word count in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output.
Input: input.txt file
Output: output.txt file
Solution:
1. The input.txt file is uploaded to the Jupyter Notebook and accessed using the open() method in read-only mode. 
2. The contents of the file are accessed and stored in a list called "contents".
3. The words in the list count are stored in a dictionary and used to write the output to a file. 

4. The open() function is used to create a file named "output.txt", and the contents of the dictionary are copied to it and downloaded to the local. 
Problem 3: To read heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a separate list using: 1) Nested Interactive loop 2) List comprehensions
Input: List
Output: List
Solution:
1. The program accepts a series of heights in centimeters from the user.
2. First, the heights are converted to inches with a loop. Second, heights are converted to inches through list comprehension.
3. The resulting lists are printed to the console.
